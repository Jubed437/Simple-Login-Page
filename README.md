# Simple Login Page

This project was created to understand the basic working of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It helped me as a beginner to learn how to structure a webpage, style it properly, and manage project files.  
I also learned how to push code to GitHub and deploy a site online using GitHub Pages.
